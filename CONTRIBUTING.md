## Using `poetry`

This package uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation) for dependency management and publishing. It is required in order to do local development with `PyCap`.

1. Install `poetry`

```sh
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python -
```

2. Install all project dependencies (including development/optional dependencies).

```sh
$ poetry install -E data_science
```

3. Add your changes and make sure your changes pass all tests.

```
$ poetry run pytest
```

If you make changes to the dependencies you'll need to handle
them with the [`poetry add/remove`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies) commands.
