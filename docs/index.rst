PyCap
=====

PyCap is an interface to the `REDCap <http://www.project-redcap.org>`_ Application Programming Interface (API). PyCap is designed to be a minimal interface exposing all required and optional API parameters. My hope is that it makes simple things easy & hard things possible.

Installation
------------

Install the latest version with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::

    $ pip install PyCap

To install the bleeding edge from the github repo, use the following::

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/sburns/PyCap.git#egg=PyCap

The only requirement is `requests <http://python-requests.org>`_ which will be installed automatically for you by ``pip``.

Philosophy
----------

The REDCap API is pretty simple. There is no built-in search or pagination, for example. However, it does expose all the functionality required to build advanced data management services on top of the API.

In the same way, PyCap is minimal by design. It doesn't do anything fancy behind the scenes and will not prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot. However, it should be very easy to understand and mentally-map PyCap functionality to the REDCap API.
