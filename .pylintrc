# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

# we're going to support as many arguments as the API calls have
disable=too-many-arguments,
        # unfortunately this has to be disabled because of similar
        # import statements across different methods (which are
        # separated by different files by design)
        duplicate-code

# make sure we're only disabling what we need to disable
enable=useless-suppression
